# Backups-and-Snapshots

Backup is a term used to describe the alternate files that are created for the purpose of recovery when the original data is either lost or corrupted. Backups are very important when you have some paramount files and you canâ€™t afford to lose them. Data can be destroyed or lost by hardware failures, software corruption or even by mistake. A virus in a system can also disrupt the contents of the file. Thus, it is very necessary to maintain the integrity of the file.
Backup copies should be made on a consistent, regular basis, so that data remains updated from time to time. It will ensure that the recovery file is fully updated and reduces the chances of data loss.
There are several options to retrieve the lost or deleted data. The elementary approach for this problem is to have an external hard disk or a flash drive to store the important data and then recover it in your PC from the drive whenever needed. These disk based backups became very efficient for large organizations for continuous data protection. With time, the size of data became large, so large, that it was impossible to store all of it on a single external hard disk device. Thus came the need of a high storage area that could contain the huge data. Cloud storage became the solution to this problem which had all the data stored securely in remote servers.
The other option for recovery of data was Snapshots.
Snapshot is a record which comprises of metadata that depicts the state of blocks and files in the storage. They allow the user to reach the previously existing state which was free from error or data loss. Data can be retrieved simply by copying the latest version from the snapshot to the original directory. Any number of snapshots can be taken depending upon the updating of data in the system. They do not require much space as each snapshot only stores the data that is not a part of the previous snapshot.
